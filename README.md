## Overview

Serenity Spa is a full-stack web application that allows users to explore spa services, book appointments, and manage their bookings. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this project provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers looking to book spa services online.

This project was built as part of a team effort to create a complete solution where users can sign up, log in, and access various features based on their authentication status. The application ensures secure user data management through JWT-based authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and log out functionality secured by JWT tokens.
- **Service Browsing**: View available spa services with detailed descriptions and prices.
- **Appointment Booking**: Book appointments for desired services and view upcoming bookings.
- **User Profile**: Manage your account information and view booking history.
- **Admin Functionality**: Admins can add, update, and delete services and manage user bookings.
